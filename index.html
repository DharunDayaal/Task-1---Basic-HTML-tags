            India is expected to overtake China to become the world’s most populous
            country sometime in July, it is said. We don’t have a firm month, because
            our census—the count of population—is more than a decade old. So, we can
            only estimate the expected overshoot date—sometime in mid-2023, we will
            match China’s 1.45 billion people and then surpass it. The question I get
            asked often is, what does this mean for the environment? There is no doubt
            that more people will need more resources to survive. But it cannot be
            argued that population growth is an indicator of the resultant
            environmental degradation. It is not as linear. The simple counter
            argument is that countries like the US with 336 million people or
            Australia with 26 million people have much greater environmental
            footprints than that of India.

        <h2>Reasons behind the population</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>1) High Rates of Fertility</h3>
        India has a large population because of its historically high fertility
        rates. A higher number of families is a result of a confluence of social,
        cultural, and economic factors. Larger families were the result of
        historical restrictions on access to family planning services and
        conventional views about the value of having children, particularly males.
        
        <h3>2) Decreased Death Tolls</h3>
        India has made tremendous strides in disease prevention, sanitation, and
        healthcare throughout the years. Lower death rates have resulted from
        these advancements, particularly for children and newborns. Naturally, the
        population grows as more people live into adulthood.
        
        <h3>3) Age Distribution </h3>
        India’s population is largely young, with a high proportion of those who
        are of reproductive age. Increased birth rates and population growth are
        caused by this demographic pyramid, which has a wide base.
